## Intro to Parallel Programming

This course goes over Parallel Algorithm design + analysis using C++ with OpenMPI. [You can view my notes taken during the lectures here!](https://hackmd.io/s/Bycfx4Bwg)

### Projects index:

- [Project 1](https://github.com/harrisonlingren/CS452/tree/master/project1): A few solutions to some "embarrasingly parallel" problems we were assigned --- [project description here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxFbYCSMHn37NVRILThuUXk0SEE).
- [Project 2](https://github.com/harrisonlingren/CS452/tree/master/project2): Just an implementation of mergesort in C++ with a driver function. [Project description here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxFbYCSMHn37cVhPTnpoSEVCYU0).
- [Project 3](https://github.com/harrisonlingren/CS452/tree/master/project3): The Mergesort algorithm, parallelized, using the ranking & shapes method. [Project description here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxFbYCSMHn37VUV3a2ZsT0JxVlU).
- [Project 4](https://github.com/harrisonlingren/CS452/tree/master/project4): An implementation of the 2-3 Tree data structure. *Not* in parallel --- project description here (coming soon).
